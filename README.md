Experiments with NSW DPIE and KOALA air quality sensors

This repository consists of a variety of experiments that draw on the data source used by the NSW Department of Planning, Industry & the Environment and sensors that are part of KOALA (Knowing Our Ambient Local Air-quality), an array of particulate matter sensors installed in the Blue Mountains.

For more information on the sensors and projects see http://bluemountains.sensors.net.au/ and https://www.dpie.nsw.gov.au/air-quality/current-air-quality
