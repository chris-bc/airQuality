Experiments with NSW DPIE and KOALA air quality sensors

This repository consists of a variety of experiments that draw on the data source used by the NSW Department of Planning, Industry & the Environment and sensors that are part of KOALA (Knowing Our Ambient Local Air-quality), an array of particulate matter sensors installed in the Blue Mountains.

For more information on the sensors and projects see http://bluemountains.sensors.net.au/ and https://www.dpie.nsw.gov.au/air-quality/current-air-quality

### Chronology of build
* blueSkies.pl - Standard 90s/00s server-side web app, with bootstrap added later to improve layout and slowly expanded
* ozSkies.pl - Moving toward HTML/JS first but still with significant reliance on server-side processing
* geoSkies.html - Full HTML and JS. I suspect my understanding of JQuery is still pretty rubbish but hey - turns out you can teach an old dog new tricks!
