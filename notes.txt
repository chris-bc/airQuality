JS-based sort
list group of columns
sort columns active with a badge showing their sort order and asc/desc
click->toggle through active/asc, active/desc, inactive
  Check whether active (If can't do that check whether badge has text)
  if active
    get badge text
      if ends with asc change to desc -> rebuilt sort string
      if ends with desc remove active, remove text -> rebuilt sort numbering -> rebuild sort string
      if empty set active asc, determine next col number -> rebuild sort string
  rebuild sort string
    loop through items looking for 1..none
  rebuild sort numbering
    // we know a number is missing - it could be 1, it could be the last, it could be in the middle
    lastnumber = 0
    loop through cols looking for lastnumber+1
      found - update last number, restart loop
      not found - loop through looking for next and subsequent numbers, subtracting 1 from them
